# Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my portfolio project. This is a portfolio site hosted on GitHub Pages as I start developing projects for school and personal interests. This site has been built using the Solid State template from [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/solid-state). Creating a static site I was looking for a well structured and customizable template. HTML5up's templates fit that description with the use of well structured, easy to navigate, Sass files. I was able to quickly update the template to create my portfolio site. 

As I complete more projects I will be keeping this site updated, building out detailed pages for more involved projects to include helpful images and videos. There are many steps one can take to create an online presence and present a portfolio. One of the biggest challenges getting started is choosing one step to get started, get it live, and let the rest be built out methodically.
